<h1> Watershed Algorithm </h1>

The watershed algorithm is used for image segmentation on grayscale images. The brightness of the pixels represents the height, and the algorithm will try to find ridges or walls that enclose an area.

We use the <strong>scikit-image library</strong> watershed function to compute the watershed of our images.

The installation instructions of each of the following frameworks, Radical Pilot, Dask, and PySpark, are explained in the README's in their respective folders.
